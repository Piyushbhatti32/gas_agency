# Agency Booking Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported that in the "Book New Cylinder" section, there was no option to select an agency. This is a critical feature as bookings need to be associated with specific agencies for proper processing.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created Agencies API Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/agencies/route.js`
- **Purpose**: Fetch all active agencies for user selection
- **Functionality**: Returns a list of agencies with their ID, business name, and city

### 2. Updated User Dashboard with Agency Selection
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added agency selection dropdown to booking form
  - Fetch agencies on component mount
  - Auto-select user's default agency if available
  - Added validation to ensure agency selection before booking
  - Updated form reset to clear agency selection

### 3. Enhanced Booking Creation API
- **File**: `src/app/api/booking/create/route.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Accept agencyId from request body
  - Use user's default agency if none selected
  - Added validation for agency assignment
  - Improved error handling for agency-related issues

### 4. Form Validation Improvements
- Added client-side validation to ensure agency selection
- Better error messaging for users
- Automatic default agency selection for returning users

## How It Works Now

1. When a user visits their dashboard, the system fetches all active agencies
2. If the user has a default agency, it's automatically selected
3. User can change the agency selection if needed
4. When booking, the system validates that an agency is selected
5. The booking is created with the proper agency association

## Benefits

- Users can now explicitly choose which agency to book with
- System falls back to default agency for convenience
- All bookings are properly associated with agencies
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing user defaults
