# Gas Agency System - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Agency Dashboard Data Loading Error
**Problem**: The agency dashboard was trying to fetch bookings from `/api/agency/bookings` but this API route didn't exist, causing data loading errors.

**Solution**: Created a new API route at `src/app/api/agency/bookings/route.js` that:
- Accepts an agencyId as a query parameter
- Fetches all bookings associated with that agency
- Includes user details in the response
- Returns bookings ordered by creation date (newest first)

### 2. Profile Pages Not Editable
**Problem**: Profile pages (both agency and user) were read-only with no way to update information.

**Solution**: Added edit functionality to both profile pages:

**Agency Profile (`src/app/agency/profile/page.js`)**:
- Added Edit/Cancel buttons to toggle edit mode
- Made all profile fields editable with appropriate input types
- Added Save Changes functionality that sends updates to the API
- Added toast notifications for success/error feedback

**User Profile (`src/app/user/profile/page.js`)**:
- Added Edit/Cancel buttons to toggle edit mode
- Made all profile fields editable with appropriate input types
- Added Save Changes functionality that sends updates to the API
- Added toast notifications for success/error feedback

**API Updates**:
- Added PUT method to `src/app/api/agency/profile/route.js` to handle agency profile updates
- Added PUT method to `src/app/api/user/profile/route.js` to handle user profile updates
- Both API routes now support both GET (for reading) and PUT (for updating) operations

### 3. User and Role Name Display
**Problem**: User name and role were not clearly visible in the UI.

**Solution**: Updated the Navigation component (`src/components/Navigation.jsx`) to:
- Display the user's name in the top right corner
- Show the user's role (USER, AGENCY, or ADMIN) in a badge next to their name
- Made this visible on all pages except login/registration pages

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/agency/bookings/route.js` - New file created for fetching agency bookings
2. `src/app/api/agency/profile/route.js` - Updated to add PUT method for updates
3. `src/app/api/user/profile/route.js` - Updated to add PUT method for updates
4. `src/components/Navigation.jsx` - Updated to display user name and role
5. `src/app/agency/profile/page.js` - Updated to make profile editable
6. `src/app/user/profile/page.js` - Updated to make profile editable

## Testing Performed

All changes have been implemented and should be tested to ensure they work correctly:

1. Agency dashboard should now load without data loading errors
2. Agency profile page should allow editing and saving of profile information
3. User profile page should allow editing and saving of profile information
4. User name and role should be visible in the navigation bar on all pages

## Implementation Notes

- All API routes properly handle errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Profile update APIs exclude sensitive fields (password, email, role) from updates
- Frontend components provide user feedback through toast notifications
- All changes maintain existing UI/UX patterns and styling
